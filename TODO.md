# FishTox - Future Development Tasks

## High Priority

### UI/UX Improvements
- [ ] Allow selecting multiple species
- [ ] Decide how to color code or otherwise visualize multiple species on both the scatterplot and the map, while still giving information about mercury levels
- [ ] Add background colors to scatterplot for consumption thresholds
- [ ] Fix extra decimals on tick labels
- [ ] Better use of space on scatterplot (also label not positioned well)
- [ ] Zooming map should filter points
- [ ] Would be nice to highlight point on map when hovered on plot
- [ ] Add favicon for better browser tab identification

### Data Visualization
- [ ] Add regression lines to scatter plot


## Medium Priority

### Features
- [ ] Add fish consumption guidelines/recommendations

### Performance

## Low Priority

### Enhancement Ideas
- [ ] Implement dark mode toggle
- [ ] Add fish images for common species
- [ ] Offline mode with service worker
- [ ] Add loading skeleton while CSV data loads

### Technical Debt
- [ ] Add comprehensive test suite
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Add error boundary components
- [ ] Implement analytics tracking
