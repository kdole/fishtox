# FishTox - Future Development Tasks

## High Priority

### UI/UX Improvements
- [ ] Improved map diplay (map is tricky: species, mercury, number of points)
- [ ] Figure out bug in map color: after un-selection a species some points had wrong color
- [ ] Would be nice to highlight point on map when hovered on plot
- [ ] Performance with species like Largemouth Bass
- [ ] Add disclaimer and link to authoritative reference
- [ ] Add "about"
  - Link to biotoxin hotline
  - Source data
  - Note about other contaminants
- [ ] Add map pins for OEHHA advisories: https://oehha.ca.gov/fish/ca-fishmap

## Low Priority

### Enhancement Ideas
- [ ] Add favicon for better browser tab identification
- [ ] Implement dark mode toggle
- [ ] Add fish images for common species
- [ ] Offline mode with service worker
- [ ] Add loading skeleton while CSV data loads

### Technical Debt
- [ ] Add comprehensive test suite
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Add error boundary components
- [ ] Remove duplication between readme and claude.md?
- [ ] Do we need anything for state management? (Zustand was removed)
