# FishTox - Future Development Tasks

## High Priority

### UI/UX Improvements
- [ ] Decide how to color code or otherwise visualize multiple species on both the scatterplot and the map, while still giving information about mercury levels
- [ ] Add background colors to scatterplot for consumption thresholds
- [ ] Implement analytics tracking (web-vitals)
- [ ] Performance with species like Largemouth Bass
- [ ] Improved display of multiple points at same map location (map is tricky: species, mercury, number of points)
- [ ] Add disclaimer and link to authoritative reference
- [ ] Add license

## Low Priority

### Enhancement Ideas
- [ ] Would be nice to highlight point on map when hovered on plot
- [ ] Add favicon for better browser tab identification
- [ ] Implement dark mode toggle
- [ ] Add fish images for common species
- [ ] Offline mode with service worker
- [ ] Add loading skeleton while CSV data loads

### Technical Debt
- [ ] Add comprehensive test suite
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Add error boundary components
- [ ] Remove duplication between readme and claude.md?
- [ ] Do we need anything for state management? (Zustand was removed)
